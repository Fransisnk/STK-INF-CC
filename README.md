# STK-INF-CC

Since this dataset is not really to be made public (request from Telenor), you'll have to check your email address for a link to a google drive storage, where you'll find the .csv file with the provided data. 

1) This file has to be put into the /res folder. 
2) start mongodb 
3) run linRegDB.py to load the data from the .csv into the mongodb.
4) now you can run linearRegression.py to run and plot the linear Regression and also the multi layer perceptron.
5) run kmeans.py to plot everything related to kmeans clustering.
6) In the google drive storage, you will also find our presentation file, the PITCHME.md, and a folder named 'plots'. With those files, the presentation file will have the pictures of plots included.

A few other things/files are not done yet or experimental. Feel free to run stuff and look around.

Disclaimer: we know that our code is far from clean and a lot of stuff is redundant. We're planning on doing a cleanup before the final delivery.
